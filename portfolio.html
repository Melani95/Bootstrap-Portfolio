          Hello! My name is Kiana Melani Nacua. My mother is Samoan and my father is Hawaiian. I was born in Orange County and have moved many times since then. 
          I love animals and romantic comedies. I understand this is a homework assignment and not a dating profile so I'll try to steer away from listing more of my intrests. 
          I currently work for a large format printing company and at a nightclub. The contrast in settings is truly symbolic of my personality. I try to experience as much as I can.

        <p class="textbreak">
          My parents have always described me as motherly despite being the middle child. Born into a traditional Samoan household, the women in my culture have high expectations and many responsibilities. 
          I was the only girl in my family for many years so that greatly influenced my way of thinking. I was told to nurture and to be passive. However, with a father who taught MMA and three aggressive brothers 
          I was not quiet and passive for long. I taught my family that a girl could do a mans job by working as a medical assistant in an urgent care while still in high school. I taught myself to drive, bought my own car, worked multiple jobs and lived alone from then on.

      <div class="col-md-3">
        <p class="textbreak">
          Now my goal in life to give back to my family. I am thankful for the family that I've been blessed with and I can think of no better way to thank them than to give them the best life I can.
           I'm currently helping remodel my parents house and buying another house nearby. I would like to see everything I learn in life with my education, career, and overall experiences benefit those close to me.
